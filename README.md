# Is Mamba Effective for Time Series Forecasting? Pushed Forward with Hierarchical Structure



## :loudspeaker: About this repository
In this repository we are extending the S-Mamba model proposed in the paper ["Is Mamba Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11144) with a hierarchical multi scale structure. Our current results indicate consistent perfomance improvements across all datasets, achieving state of the art performance in most cases. Hierarchical model will be made available soon.
